        <h3>Reference Model</h3>
        <p>The IIFAA decentralized trusted authentication service reference model is depicted in Figure 1. It comprises four
        pivotal roles: issuer, service provider, identity provider, and DID holder; two key data types: VCs and VPs; and a
        foundational infrastructure: IIFAA decentralized trusted authentication infrastructure (cloud-chain).</p>
          <div><img src="img/Figure1.png" height="400" width="auto"/><p>Figure 1 Reference Model</p></div>
          <p>The IIFAA decentralized trusted authentication service specifically includes:</p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Organizations or individuals in the decentralized trusted authentication ecosystem must register a DID through an
              identity provider and upload decentralized identity documents containing their identity public key to the blockchain for
              storage and verification;
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon user request, issuers grant VCs to the user side for encrypted storage;
            </li>
            <li>
              When users need to present relevant VCs in specific service scenarios, they authorize, assemble, and issue a verifiable
              presentation on their side, which is then submitted to the service provider;
            </li>
            <li>
              The service provider, utilizing the infrastructure, accesses the public keys of users and issuers, verifies the user's
              authorization and the issuer's identity within the verifiable presentation, and upon successful validation, provides the
              requisite services based on the declared content meeting service scenario needs.

            <h5>VC Presentation</h5>
            <p>Based on current scenario requirements, users are provided with a selection and authorization of VC content that meets
            the criteria. Following the principle of minimal privacy disclosure, users select and authorize the presentation of
            relevant fields. Then, according to standard protocols, a VP is assembled, and signed with the DID private key, and the
            signed VP information is presented to the scenario-based service provider for validation. Throughout the entire process,
            the handling and signing of VCs are carried out within a secure environment on the user side. This is done following the
            principle of minimal privacy disclosure for both selection and authorization, ensuring the security and privacy of user
            data. The requirements for VC presentation functionality are as follows:</p>
            <ol type="a">

          <h4>VC Template Management</h4>
          <p>The IIFAA ecologic operation platform shall provide the management of VC templates to constrain the attribute profiles
          of the VCs issued by issuers. The attribute profile management ensures unified attribute fields of VC templates. An
          issuer can request issuing VCs in a specified VC template, and after the request is approved, the issuer can issue VCs
          using this template. SPs can query VCs that are already issued by issuers through scenario configurations, and use the
          appropriate VCs.</p>
          <p>VC templates shall be hierarchical. That is, legal identity VC templates are available for legal identity issuers only,
          and general identity VC templates are available for both legal identity issuers and general identity issuers. In
          addition, VC templates should be classified according to different industries, and their application scopes shall be
          clearly defined.</p>
          <p>For this feature, the IIFAA platform:</p>

            <li>Shall have the capability to approve VC templates as an issuer. When an issuer applies for a VC template, the VC
            template needs to be reviewed by the IDP operator, and after that, the issuer can issue VCs using this VC template;</li>
            <li>Shall have the capability to query the VC template list as a specified issuer, that is to query all VC templates that
            have been reviewed and approved by issuers. SPs can configure their service scenario policies using these templates.</li>

      <h2>Service Procedure</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Organization Registration Procedure</h3>
        <p>In the decentralized trusted authentication system, organizations fall into two categories: VC issuers who issue VCs to
        users, and SPs who, based on the VPs given by users, obtain user information and provide services. The prerequisite for
        the healthy operation of the decentralized trusted authentication system is that users hold reliable VCs. Therefore,
        when registering with the unified service and control platform, issuers need to go through an authentication procedure
        to verify that they are authoritative and reliable. Although the right to use data belongs to users, for healthy data
        transfer, SPs also need to go through authentication to avoid malicious information collection and data abuse.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>Issuer Registration</h4>
          <img src="img/Figure3.png" height="400" width="auto"/><p>Figure 3 Issuer Registration Procedure</p>
          <p>The issuer registration procedure is shown in Figure 3. During registration, an issuer needs to submit related
          information as required by the unified service and control platform. After the information is reviewed, the platform
          notifies the IDP to generate a DID for the issuer and uploads some information to the blockchain for publicity. Issuers
          are divided into legal organizations and ordinary organizations. The digital VCs issued by legal organizations are more
          authoritative and have a wider range of application scenarios. Therefore, legal organizations need to go through a more
          stringent authentication, for which, CA-based authentication is recommended. For ordinary organizations, domain
          name-based authentication is recommended. The specific issuer registration procedure is as follows:</p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              An issuer generates private keys and stores them securely (1).

            </li>
            <li>
              The issuer submits information such as public keys, website domain name, and website name to the unified service and
              control platform (2).
            
            </li>
            <li>
            The issuer selects an appropriate authentication method depending on its organization type. If the issuer is a legal
            organization, it selects CA authentication and submits a CA certificate issued by an authoritative CA agency for
            authentication. If the issuer is an ordinary organization, it goes through domain name-based authentication (3).
            </li>
            <li>
            The unified service and control platform reviews and verifies the information submitted by the issuer. After successful
            verification, the platform notifies the IDP to generate a DID, uploads it to the blockchain, and returns the related
            information to the issuer (4, 5, 6, 7).
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4>SP Registration</h4>
          <img src="img/Figure4.png" height="400" width="auto"/><p>Figure 4 SP Registration Procedure</p>
          <p>The SP registration procedure is shown in Figure 4. During registration, an SP submits information as required. After
          the information is reviewed, the IDP generates the corresponding DID and uploads some information to the blockchain.
          When creating an application scenario, the SP can select a specified issuer as the data issuer. To prevent SPs from
          maliciously collecting and abusing data, the unified service and control platform or issuer will review the SP's
          scenario access based on the issuer's data use requirements. After the review, the scenario is configured for future
          use. The specific procedure is as follows:</p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>An SP generates private keys and stores them securely (1).</li>
            <li>The SP submits information such as name, logo, and public keys to the unified service and control platform (2).</li>
            <li>The platform reviews and verifies the information submitted by the SP. After the information is reviewed, the platform
            notifies the IDP to generate a DID, uploads it to the blockchain, and returns it to the SP (3, 4).</li>
            <li>The SP creates an application scenario on the platform and specifies the dependent data source (5).</li>
            <li>If the issuer specifies that approval is required for its VCs, the SP initiates an application (6).</li>
            <li>After the application is approved by the issuer, the platform generates the scenario configuration for future use by the
            SP (7).</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>VC Issuance Procedure</h3>
        <p>The VC issuance procedure is shown in Figure 5. A user creates a DID and applies for a VC on the terminal, and the
        corresponding issuer authenticates the user's identity and then issues the VC. The issuance procedure is the same for
        different types of VC, with some differences in user authentication. To issue a legal identity credential, the
        corresponding issuer authenticates the user's identity through face and ID comparison. To issue a service credential or
        digital asset credential, the corresponding issuer can authenticate the user's identity through face and ID comparison
        or based on the user's legal identity credential on the terminal.</p>
        <img src="img/Figure6.png" height="400" width="auto"/><p>Figure 6 VP Procedure</p>
        <p>The VC issuance procedure is as follows:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>A user initiates a request for creating a DID on the app (1).</li>
          <li>The trusted key components of the terminal generate public and private keys (2).</li>
          <li>The terminal uploads public keys to the IDP and initiates a request for creating a DID (3).</li>
          <li>The IDP generates a DID document based on the public keys and uploads the public keys and DID document to the blockchain
          (4).</li>
          <li>The terminal receives the DID document returned by the IDP and calls the trusted storage components for data storage
          (5).</li>
          <li>The terminal applies for a VC from the issuer (6).</li>
          <li>Depending on the type of the applied VC, the issuer authenticates the user's identity using an appropriate method (7).</li>
          <li>The issuer signs the VC with its own DID private key and then encrypts it with the user's DID public key. The encrypted
          data is sent to the terminal, which stores it securely through the trusted storage component (8).</li>

        </ol>
        <p>In the above steps, if the terminal already has a DID, ignore steps a) to e), and go to step f) directly.</p>

        <h3>VP Procedure</h3>
        <img src="img/Figure5.png" height="400" width="auto"/><p>Figure 5 VC Issuance Procedure</p>
        <p>The VP procedure is shown in Figure 6. To enjoy the services provided by an SP, a user needs to apply for a VC from the
        asset issuer and generate a VP per the SP's service scenario requirements. After the VP is generated, the SP verifies
        the VP to complete user authentication, and then provides services for the user. The specific procedure is as follows:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Before using the services provided by an SP, a user needs to submit his/her data and information for authentication (1).</li>
          <li>The terminal queries the configurations of the SP, and obtains the SP's requirements for user data in this scenario (2).</li>
          <li>The user authorizes the application vendor and VC corresponding to the presentation.</li>
          <li>The terminal selects a proper VC based on the configurations, constructs VP content using the SP's DID and public key,
          and then signs the VP content with the user's private key to generate a VP (4).</li>
          <li>The terminal encrypts the VP with the SP's public key and then transmits it to the SP (5).</li>
          <li>The SP decrypts and verifies the VP data, and authenticates the user information based on the original data (6).</li>
          <li>The SP authenticates the user, and then provides services for the user (7).</li>
